VMOD

Bunch of helpful R functions for working with 
* text, 
* text mining, 
* natural language processing,
* some basic machine learning etc.

Work easily with text files in directories, tokenize them, merge them into larger corpora, create bag-of-words model, apply TF-IDF, train some algo and evaluate. See examples inside the files.

**Working with texts & ML:**
